DownloadOrganizer
=================

The intention is to create a complete solution to automated identification of downloaded movies and tv shows including moving and organizing the files into the correct directories on your disk. This app is also capable of unraring the rar files you download. The goal is to have a complete web ui for showing the automated results and to modify misidentifications if necessary. You put this web app on the server you use for downloading files and then you can connect go to this app when you want to move all your new downloads to their correct locations.

To run this app first make sure you have rails and rubys setup on your server.

Then clone the repository:
    
    cd /where/you/want/to/put/the/app
    git clone https://github.com/DylanGriffith/DownloadOrganizer.git
    cd DownloadOrganizer
    
Install gems:

    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    
Now setup your environment the way you want it. You will need to edit the settings file to reflect where new downloads are stored, where you store your movies and where you store your tv shows. Lastly you will need to set the username and password you want to have for accessing the web page.

    cp config/settings.example.json config/settings.json
    vim config/settings.json
   
Now run the app:

    RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails s
