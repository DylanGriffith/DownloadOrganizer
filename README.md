DownloadOrganizer
=================

This is my first attempt at learning Ruby. My intention is to create a complete solution to automated identification of downloaded movies and tv shows including moving and organizing the files into the correct directories on your disk. The goal is to have a complete web ui for showing the automated results and to modify misidentifications if necessary.
